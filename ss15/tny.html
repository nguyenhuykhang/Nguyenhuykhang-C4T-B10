    Oliver uses nature as a springboard to the sacred - the beating heart of her work

    <p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Bker's novel "<u>The Anthologist</u>," scrawls in the margin of Oliver's "<U>New and Selected Poems, Volume One</U>." A
        struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfrienf, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the
        long=overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke,
        Sara Teasdale = before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing.". Of her poems, he says,"They're very simple. And yet each has
        something."

        I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
        <br>
        I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down
        <br>
        into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,
        <br>
        how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,
        <br>
        which is what I have been doing all day.

    </p>
    </ul>
    <p>The cadences are almost Biblical."Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere.
